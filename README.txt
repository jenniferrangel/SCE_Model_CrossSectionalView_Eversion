Examples of different perturbations or mechanism that can be tested using this codecan be found in the 
Examples_of_perturbations folder:
  Inside this folder, there is a list of subfolders that contain different examples which will be listed below.
  To run any of the provided examples, the user must replace the files inside any of the following subfolders with the 
  files inside ./src/srcGPU.
    (1) CombinedPerturbation_CellProlifANDCytoskeletalRegulators: 
            * The tissue is split into 2 domains Anterior (A)|Posterior (P). 
            * Cell proliferation and cytoskeletal regulators are perturned only on the posterior side of the tissue. 
                  (i) Case I: Increase proliferation and actomyosin contractility on the posterior side.
                  (ii) Case II: Increase proliferation and ECM stiffness on the posterior side.
                  (iii) Case III: Increase proliferation and cell-ECM adhesion on the posterior side.

            * The tissue is split into 2 domains Anterior (A)|Posterior (P). 
            * In this example one can increase or decrease the proliferation rate in the posterior compartment. 
    (3) PatternedProliferationRate
            * The tissue is split into 3 domains L|M|L where M represents the medial domain and L represents the 
              two lateral sides.
            * In this example one can increase or decrease proliferation in the medial or lateral ends to test the 
              role of patterned proliferation.
    (4) Patterning_ActomyosinContractility
            * The tissue is split into 3 domains L|M|L where M represents the medial domain and L represents the 
              two lateral sides.
            * Apical and basal contractility is higher in the medial region. However, the code can be modified to 
              increase or decrease apical and basal contractility in the M or L domains.
    (5) Patterning_BasalECMStiffness
            * The tissue is split into 3 domains L|M|L where M represents the medial domain and L represents the 
              two lateral sides.
            * ECM stiffness is decreased by 50% in lateral sides as compared to the medial domain. 
            * The code can be easily modified to increase or decrease ECM stiffness in any of the domains.
    (6) Patterning_cellECMAdhesion

              two lateral sides.
            * The code can be easily modified to increase or decrease apical, basal and lateral membrane tension 
              in any of the 3 domains.

            * The tissue is split into 3 domains L|M|L where M represents the medial domain and L represents the 
              two lateral sides.
            * In this example we test the case of uniform proliferation across the tissue but higher cell-ECM adhesion 
              in the medial domain.
            * The code can be modified to pattern proliferation as well as increase or decrease cell-ECM adhesion in 
              any of the domains.
    (9) VaryCellPressure_by_ChangingCellVolume
            * In this example, cell pressure is varied by changing the target cell volume in the Lagrange Multiplier.
            * This can be tested using (1) a linear gradient or (2) a step function. Both examples have been provided.

Output files generated by the model simulations:
    (1) The print out file that is generated for every job submission. This file will be named according to what the user 
        decides to label the output in line 7 of EpiScale_run.sh. 
            * For example, if the user sets output=Test, then the print out file will be called Test. 
            * This file includes important information such as number of cells, cell order, number of ECM nodes, etc.
    (2) dataOutput folder: Stores all txt files with a "detailedStat_'' prefix. These files include information about every 
        cell such as its rank, number of neighbors, cell area, cell center, cell pressure and the position of the apical 
        node, basal node and nucleus center. 
            * For an example, see the provided sample file detailedStat_example.txt.
    (3) ECMFolder: Includes txt files with information about the ECM nodes along with the vtk files for visualizing the 
        ECM nodes.
    (4) animation folder: Includes vtk files for viewing simulation results. These files store the information for 
        visualizing the nuclei and membrane nodes.
            * machine1 folder: if the flat tissue initial condition is used, the vtk files will be stored here. 
            * machine2 folder: if the curved tissue initial condition is used, the vtk files will be stored here.

Note: The vtk files inside the ECMFolder and animation folders are required for visualizing the results and creating simulation videos.
   
********************************************
[Data processing]
The data processing files can be found inside the DataProcessing folder:
    * ExtractApiBasNucInfo.m: used to extract the apical node, basal node, and nucleus center information.
    * CalcCellHeight.m: used to calculate the cell height using the apical and basal nodes of each individual cell.
    * CalcNuclearPositioning.m: used to calculate the nuclear positioning using the apical node, basal node and 
     nucleus center of each individual cell.

Instructions on how to use these files:
1. The ExtractApiBasNucInfo.m must be ran first. It requires inputs from (1) the "detailedStat_" files inside the dataOutput
   folder and (2) the printout file created. More specifically:
     (i) The input for cell information has to be extracted manually from files with a "detailedStat_" prefix. 
         Every triplet (row-wise, i.e. row1 ~ row3) represents the apical node, basal node, and nucleus center 
         position, respectively. For the detail on what information is presented in the files with "detailedStat_" prefix, 
         see detailedStat_example.txt in the dataOutput folder.
     (ii) For simulations involving growth, the order of cells must be entered to acquire the correct calculations. 
          The cell order can be found in the printout created (see EpiScale_run.sh). 
2. Then the files CalcCellHeight.m and CalcNuclearPositioning.m can be ran to extract the cell height and nuclear positioning 
   for any desired simulation.
